# TruSource Customer Churn Prediction

## Business Problem
TruSource is experiencing customer churn, which threatens long-term revenue stability and growth. The objective of this project was to build a predictive analytics model to identify customers at high risk of churning and provide actionable business recommendations to reduce churn.

## Key Results
- Achieved a ROC-AUC of 0.837 on the test dataset
- Identified tenure, monthly charges, contract type, and internet tech type as top churn drivers
- Identified three customer segments and proposed targeted retention strategies for each one based on their unique pain points

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open the Jupyter notebook
4. Run all cells in order

## Limitation or Risk
The model is based on historical data and assumes future customer behavior will follow similar patterns. Changes in pricing, promotions, or market conditions could reduce model accuracy over time.
